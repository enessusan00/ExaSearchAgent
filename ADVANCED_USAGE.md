# Advanced Usage Guide for Exa Search Agent

This guide provides advanced techniques and patterns for getting the most out of the Exa Search Agent.

## Effective Search Techniques

### Exa Neural Search Prompting

Exa's neural search works best when your query describes the kind of content you want to find, ending with a colon. For example:

```
Here's a great article about quantum computing breakthroughs in 2024:
```

This pattern helps the neural search model understand exactly what you're looking for.

### Combining Search Types

For comprehensive research, try using both neural and keyword searches:

```
First, search for "semiconductor shortage automotive industry" using keyword search to get precise matches.
Then, do a neural search for "Here's an analysis of how chip shortages have impacted car manufacturing:"
```

### Finding Expert Sources

To find content from authoritative sources:

```
Find me academic papers about climate change adaptation strategies from universities
```

## Advanced Content Retrieval

### Tailored Highlights

Request highlights that focus on specific aspects:

```
Search for information about renewable energy implementation in developing countries and extract highlights specifically about cost challenges
```

### Comparative Analysis

Get content from different sources to compare perspectives:

```
Find articles about the ethics of AI from both technology companies and philosophy departments, and summarize the key differences in their approaches
```

## Research Workflows

### Literature Review

```
I'm starting a literature review on machine learning in drug discovery. Can you:
1. Find 5 recent review papers on this topic
2. For each paper, extract the methodology section highlights
3. Find similar papers to the most comprehensive review
```

### Topic Exploration

```
I'm exploring the field of quantum cryptography. Can you:
1. Find introductory resources that explain the basic concepts
2. Then find more technical resources that discuss recent advancements
3. Finally, find papers that address practical implementations
```

## Special Content Types

### Finding Specific Document Types

For PDFs, academic papers, or government reports:

```
Find PDF reports about water conservation strategies published by environmental agencies
```

### Discovering Tools and Resources

```
Search for open-source tools for natural language processing with Python
```

### Finding Code Examples

```
Find GitHub repositories with examples of reinforcement learning implementations
```

## Exa Search Operators

While using the agent, you can leverage Exa's advanced search operators:

### Date Filters

```
Find research on mRNA vaccines published after 2021
```

### Domain Filters

```
Search for climate policy information from .gov and .edu domains only
```

### Combining Multiple Criteria

```
Find information about sustainable agriculture techniques from university websites published in the last two years
```

## Troubleshooting Search Results

If you're not getting good results:

1. **Reformulate your query**: Try rephrasing or being more specific
2. **Switch search types**: If neural search isn't working well, try keyword search or vice versa
3. **Add context**: Provide more background about what you're looking for
4. **Use filters**: Narrow down by date, domain type, or content category

Remember that the agent is designed to help you iteratively improve your search, so don't hesitate to refine based on initial results!
